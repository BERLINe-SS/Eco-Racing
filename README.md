# Eco Racing – STM32 Line Follower Car

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed for the **Eco Racing Competition** at Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering, where our team achieved **2nd place overall**.  
It features an **STM32-based autonomous line follower vehicle** with an advanced path correction algorithm designed for high accuracy and reliability.  

Unlike basic line followers that only track a single path, our system uses **dual-line detection** and an intelligent control strategy that can **detect deviation, reverse, and realign** itself, ensuring continuous path following even in challenging track conditions.
